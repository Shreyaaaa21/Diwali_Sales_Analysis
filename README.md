The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze sales data during the Diwali festival period using the Python libraries Pandas and Seaborn. Diwali is a major festival celebrated in India, known for its vibrant atmosphere and increased consumer spending. By analyzing sales data from this period, we can gain insights into customer behavior, popular products, and sales trends, which can be valuable for businesses to make informed decision
